        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Zothani Zulu. I was born on the 25th of March 1998. Growing up, I always wanted to become a medical doctor.
            I could not see myself doing anything else except for working in a hospital and saving lives on a daily basis. I matriculated 
            in 2016 and my marks were not that good. I was rejected by the school of medicine that I applied to. I had to change my plans. I managed to get into university and I am doing my second year at UKZN. 
            During my freshman year, I taught myself how to program and I fell in love with it instantly!

            <h2>My skills</h2>
            <p>
               I've gained knowledge in different programming languages. I use HTML for front end development, CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.
               For example, this website was designed using HTML and CSS. There is no hardcore programming behind it. I wanted 
               to make it simple and user friendly. As far as backend programming goes, I am very fluent in PHP and SQL. These two 
               languages allow me to interact with databases using a website. A quick example of this would be making a blog where 
               an administrator can login and write a post. This type of functionality requires a server side language such as PHP. I am
               also teaching myself some frameworks such as Bootstrap and CodeIgnitor. I learn something new everyday and I believe that this habit
               will allow me to produce great work.
